# Jera-Spring
 Back-end server for my Android project.
 This is a Spring application for an online shop coffee app.

 The code is written using TDD concept.
 because I started this project before I knew how to write TDD, I added my tests after writing a small portion of the project and continued with pure TDD.
 
 Please take into consideration that this project is not done!
